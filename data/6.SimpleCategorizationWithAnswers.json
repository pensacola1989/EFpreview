        "Stimulus": "<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br />Last week, I was with my son, Thomas, watching a Western, which is a genre of movies set in a small city in the US during the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. _____________. There&rsquo;s always a good guy and a bad guy, there&rsquo;s usually some female interest, and it usually ends with a chase.<br /><br /><strong>Paragraph 2</strong><br />It&rsquo;s true, as Thomas pointed out, that these conventions apply to today&rsquo;s action movies as well. _____________. But there&rsquo;s more to it than that. Something about the American West of a hundred or more years ago took such a hold of American culture, and consequently the culture of the rest of the western world in the 20th century. I must first say, frankly, that I think the cultural manifestation of the American West that most of us over 50 hold in our psyches probably bears little or no relation to the historical reality.<br /><br /><strong>Paragraph 3</strong><br />In other words, please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m writing about real-life cowboys. Rather, I&rsquo;m thinking of that heroic figure in our imagination and in the movies, the embodiment of rugged individualism, moving cattle around a vast, lawless landscape. _____________. Granted, the cattle owner, or the local sheriff, might be listened to. But even so, the collectivism which springs from sharing harsh conditions would lend itself to egalitarianism. I think we find that aspect very appealing.<br /><br /><strong>Paragraph 4</strong><br />Another thing is how the difficult living conditions and lack of established order led to social mores that favored a simplistic settlement of grievances. As I mentioned, the movies always featured an unscrupulous villain, usually wearing black. In any case, most movies contained wonderful scenes where the rugged hero would tolerate the scoundrel&rsquo;s provocative ways for only so long. And then, his independence coming to the forefront, he&rsquo;d deal with the situation emphatically &ndash; usually with his fists or his gun. _____________. All Westerns had female characters, but they were unlikely to take a decisive role, and would swoon at the smallest prospect of trouble.<br /><br /><strong>Paragraph 5</strong><br />To sum up, I think we liked these movies and the culture they presented because they showed us a life where everyone was more or less equal, where life was simple and to the point. People were able to be themselves and to rely on themselves. Problems were resolved, if not easily, (it sometimes took a whole movie for the hero to resolve his problems with the bad guy), then at least decisively. _____________. Granted, he wouldn&rsquo;t be watching any more westerns any time soon. He said to me, &ldquo;No, Dad. You get all the same stuff in a 3D action movie. And the special effects are way better.&rdquo;</p>",
