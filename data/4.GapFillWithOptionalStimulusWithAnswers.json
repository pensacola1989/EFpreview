I know that it&#39;s not much, and I hate digging and planting flowers and stuff. But I&rsquo;m going to the&nbsp;<em>kerepar</em>&nbsp;store next month and I really need the money. I&#39;m tired of walking to school every day, and it&rsquo;ll be great to ride past my friends so fast!<br /><br /><strong>Helga</strong><br />My mother doesn&#39;t give me much pocket money each week &ndash;&nbsp;just a few hundred kronor &ndash; and you can&#39;t buy much with that, can you? Usually I spend it on&nbsp;<em>saelgaeti&nbsp;</em>from the local stores. I really like the lemon flavored ones, but I usually give half of them to my baby brother. My parents are always too busy to look after him.<br /><br /><strong>Loto</strong><br />Even though my parents are some of the wealthiest people on the island, they only give me twenty tala per week. After all the time that I spent helping my little sister to learn stuff, they only give me this little amount of money. I&#39;m saving my money to go to the&nbsp;<em>tusi</em>&nbsp;store. They&#39;re selling the latest tusi&nbsp;by the famous novelist, Jane Mino. I love her adventure stories!<br /><br /><strong>Mamello</strong><br />Each month I get forty loti from my dad to spend. His shirts always need cleaning after he finishes work, so he gives them to me. I&rsquo;d love to buy a new bike or something, but I&#39;m saving all my money for the new&nbsp;<em>apara</em>&nbsp;I&#39;ve seen in the store. I want something great to wear with my new shoes at my cousin&#39;s wedding next month.<br /><br /><strong>Arturo</strong><br />My sixteenth birthday was last week, and can you believe, my father gave me one hundred sol!&nbsp;I&#39;ve never had this much money in my whole life. Next week, I&#39;m going straight to the&nbsp;<em>sapatu</em>&nbsp;store to buy the best that I can. No more walking with bare feet for me! Now I can really give our pets some good exercise.</p>",
